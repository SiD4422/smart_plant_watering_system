Operation
System monitors temperature, light and moisture
Waters when:
Temp > 24Â°C
Light < 80
Moisture < Max level
5 minute safety timeout on watering
Touch increases moisture level (max 8)
LED matrix shows moisture level
OLED displays all sensor readings
Bluetooth sends data for remote monitoring
Safety Features
Max watering time limit
System init checks
Error indication via buzzer
Debug Mode
Set DEBUG to 1 for serial monitoring of:

Sensor readings
System status
Water events
Errors
Error Codes
Continuous short beeps = OLED init failed Continuous long beeps = Temp sensor init failed

Bluetooth Data Format
temperature,light_level,moisture_level,water_status
